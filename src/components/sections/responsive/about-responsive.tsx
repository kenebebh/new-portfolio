              I'm a full-stack developer who loves building products that don't
              just look good but actually help businesses grow, engage users,
              and scale effectively.
            </p>

                I'm drawn to projects that challenge me, push me to think
                outside the box, and ultimately make a difference for both
                businesses and users. I thrive in fast-paced startup
                environments, where I'm constantly learning, solving real
                problems, and collaborating with teams to bring ideas to life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond coding, I'm into indie hacking, community-driven tech,
                and food üçïüç£‚Äîbecause good code and good food just make life
                better! I believe great products are born from collaboration,
                curiosity, and a commitment to continuous learning‚Äîand that's
                exactly the kind of environment I love being part of..
